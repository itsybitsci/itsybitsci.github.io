            <p>My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 100, because even though doing frontend stuff is not my thing,
                I'm still really learning a lot. My favorite GE subject so far is COMM 10, because I took it with my crush back then lol.
                My favorite Programming Language so far is Python, because its syntax is so easy to understand plus it has so many
                great libraries like Scikit-Learn which I used when I created my first program with machine learning.
                My favorite Food is Ice Cream, because nah who doesn't like ice cream????.
            </p>
